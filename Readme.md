# WOW DataTracker Addon

DataTracker is a WOW Addon to track looted items and fighted units in an ingame database.
The data can be used later for a graphical UI to search for items or units.

The resulting database is saved to a lua file which could be also imported to a website to build a nice looking Website out of it.

To show or export the data, find the file DataTracker.lua in your interface directory:
